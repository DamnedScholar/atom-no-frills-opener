# No Frills Opener

Many people have remarked that Atom's inability to handle large files is a barrier against adoption. There are multiple facets of Atom that have driven people away, from the slowness of its handling big files to the fact that line wrapping is mandatory. This is an attempt to offer an alternative way of opening problematic files, by generating a primitive buffer with none of the advanced features of Atom's usual TextBuffer.

## Contributing

I made this package to fulfill a specific and limited need: to access massive files in Atom without the busybody editor slowing things down. I don't intend to make non-bug-fix improvements unless inspiration strikes me. This package is supposed to provide a Notepad-like environment, not a full-featured code editor. I'm happy to accept pull requests for features that are useful and have low overhead.
